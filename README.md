#HC-SR04 Animation
A simple program for plotting HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor output using matplotlib. The sensor data is read from a microcontroller through serial a serial connection and plotted in real time. The script currently shows only one sensor. The goal is to have four sensors from which to read data and create a 360 system.
